# Snake-and-seeds
an AI course project in University of Tehran<br>
using search algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDS(Iterative Deepening Search), A* and weighted A*, we have implemented an artificial snake and seeds game which will eat all the seeds without losing in the least possible moves.<br>
the test data should be in a text file in the format below:<br>
N, M (N * M size of table)<br>
starting_x, starting_y<br>
num_of_houses_with_seeds<br>
for i < num_of_hoses_with_seeds:<br>
  x, y, num_of_seeds<br>
