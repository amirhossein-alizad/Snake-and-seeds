# Snake-and-seeds
an AI course project in University of Tehran\n
using search algorithms including BFS, DFS, IDS(Iterative Deepening Search), A* and weighted A*, we have implemented an artificial snake and seeds game which will eat all the seeds without losing in the least possible moves.\n
the test data should be in a text file in the format below:\n
N, M (N * M size of table)\n
starting_x, starting_y\n
num_of_houses_with_seeds\n
for i < num_of_hoses_with_seeds:\n
  x, y, num_of_seeds\n
